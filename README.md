# Jatayu: AI-Driven Unified Data Platform for Marine Intelligence

Jatayu is a cloud-native, AI-driven Unified Data Platform engineered to ingest, standardize, and synthesize India's fragmented marine datasets. By unifying oceanographic, fisheries, and molecular biodiversity (eDNA) data, Jatayu provides a single source of truth to power sustainable management of our Blue Economy.

## The Problem

India's marine data ecosystem is critically fragmented, leading to significant challenges [1]:

  * **Data Silos:** Oceanographic, fisheries, and eDNA datasets exist in isolation, preventing a holistic view.
  * **Integration Gap:** A mix of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data formats resist harmonization.
  * **Delayed Decisions:** Policymakers and scientists lack the real-time, unified insights needed for proactive governance.

## Our Vision

Jatayu aims to be the central nervous system for India's marine sector. Our mission is to transform disconnected data into actionable intelligence, enabling a paradigm shift from reactive observation to predictive stewardship. We empower scientists, support policymakers, and help secure the livelihoods of coastal communities.

## Key Features

  * **AI-Powered Data Ingestion:** Automated ingestion, cleaning, and tagging of diverse marine datasets using international metadata standards.[1]
  * **Intelligent Data Fabric:** A unique system for semantic linking across oceanography, morphology (otolith analysis), and eDNA data.[1]
  * **Real-Time Analytics Engine:** A high-throughput pipeline for cross-domain correlation and predictive modeling.[1]
  * **Interactive WebGIS Portal:** A user-friendly interface for data exploration, visualization, and insight generation.[1]
  * **Specialized AI Modules:** Dedicated dashboards and models for Otolith analysis, Taxonomy, and eDNA processing.[1]

## Technical Architecture

Jatayu is built on a modern, scalable, and resilient cloud-native architecture designed for hyperscale operations. The system is event-driven, leveraging a microservices pattern to ensure modularity and fault tolerance.
